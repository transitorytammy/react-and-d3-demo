React
- virtual DOM (under the hood)
- redux (state management)
- key (needs to be unique to the list not the whole application)
- use production version of react to get it to load faster

D3
 - handles everything as an Object

 - scales (functions that map a domain to a range)
 - array operations
 - data loading

 - good parts
  - selections (select dom nodes)
    - similar to jquery selections
    - you don't really need them when using react
  - axes
  - shapes
  - transitions


- D3 does props
  - react handles the document
  - d3 functions calculate prop values
  - make sure d3 inner state stays in sync
- blackbox component (react acts a wrapper)
